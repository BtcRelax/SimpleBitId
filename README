SimpleBitID
v0.01
Copyright (C) 2014  Antoine FERRON


This is a really basic client for BitID protocol
for Windows (XP, 2k, Vista, 7, 8 & 8.1).
Minimal but easy to use. The main goal is to 
provide API in python for a client implementation
of the BitID protocol.

Just install the exe in "bin" and enjoy!
When clicking on a "bitid://" link in your browser,
it will launch SimpleBitID and identify you.

Bit ID Protocol
https://github.com/bitid/bitid/blob/master/BIP_draft.md
Demos : http://bitid.bitcoin.blue/
or http://bitid-demo.herokuapp.com/

No GUI for now. Just use a 256 bits key in your
directory. Random source is CryptGenRandom.

At startup, it generates your private key in
%APPDATA%\SimpleBitID

ECDSA uses random "k", not deterministic signing.


Possible improvements:
- PIN or password to read private key file (AES encrytion)
- GUI
- Compatibility with Linux and MacOSX
- Use other random sources
- Determinstic ECDSA (RFC 6979)


Compilation (make of bin installer):
